# RAS: Reactive Application System

This project idea was borne of the desire to have a text baased advenutre with an AI DungeonMaster.  It is now a nice looking chatGPT wrapper as I continue work on a new text based adventure webapp.

How to setup:

- Create a .env file on the top level (RAS/.env).
- Add the following to the .env file.  You will need to generate a [chatgpt api key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to test with.
```VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR KEY HERE NO BRACKETS```
- Run the following to install necessary packages.
```npm i```
- Run the following to run the server locally.  
```npm run dev```
- Ask ChatGPT some questions, get answers and potentially be berated.
